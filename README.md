The MATLAB code creates an animated visualization of B-spline functions and their Fourier transforms. Key components:

Mathematical elements:


Generates B-splines up to order 5 using convolution
Calculates both numerical and theoretical Fourier transforms
Computes phase information


Visualization features:


Three-panel display: B-spline, Fourier magnitude, and phase
Color-coded overlays of previous orders
Properties box showing key metrics
30-second display per order with countdown


Technical aspects:


Uses single figure window with white background
Implements interactive pan/zoom
Handles memory efficiently with cell arrays
Provides proper normalization of transforms
